## Simple_Databaker_Output_Structure

a simple structure template for use with databaker.

## Usage:

Replace the structure_csv_default.py script in your local databaker installation (mine was in C:\python34\Lib\site-packages\databaker) with the one provided in this repository.

This is in no way mandatory but should help you get started and move away from the databaker default (a less than ideal format required by an old ONS data system).
